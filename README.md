# NanoDropPlotter
A tool to view multiple NanoDrop result files, no more terrible screen shots of the output!
Just save the report file from your nanodrop (.ndv), and you can import multiple files to the shiny tool to compare outputs.

The tool currently offers to ability to save:
  - The plot as a tiff image
  - The combined results table as a tab-delimited file
  - An A4 size PDF containing both plot and table together

Example:

Current issues:
- Samples need to have unique names
- Sample order in plot and table differ (plot is alphabetical)
