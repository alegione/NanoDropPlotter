# NanoDropPlotter
A tool to view multiple NanoDrop result files, no more crappy screen shots of the output!
Just save the report file (.ndv), and you can import multiple files to the shiny tool to compare outputs.

The tool currently offers to ability to save the plot as an image, and the combined results table as a tab-delimited file

Current issues:
- Samples need to have unique names
